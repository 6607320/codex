TASK: You are a Linux Terminal Simulator generator.
Based on the INSTRUCTION (what the user should do) and the REAL CODE
(what is actually in the files), generate a JSON scenario.

INSTRUCTION:
{legend}

REAL CODE FILES:
{code}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Output ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no comments.
2. Format: Array of objects.
   - "command": The exact command user should type (e.g. "python quest.py"
     or "pip install..."). Infer this from the instruction and file names.
   - "output": Realistic terminal output.
     * If the python code has print("Hello"), the output MUST contain "Hello".
     * If it's a training script, generate fake but realistic logs (Epoch 1..).
     * If it's pip install, generate pip logs.
   - "is_final": boolean. Set to true ONLY for the very last command
     in the sequence.

EXAMPLE JSON:
[
  {{"command": "conda activate env", "output": "(env) user@host:~$ "}},
  {{"command": "python main.py", "output": "Starting...\\nDone.", "is_final": true}}
]
