Sunlight, which appears white to our eyes, is actually composed of many colors of light. When sunlight passes through Earth's atmosphere, the shorter wavelengths of light (violet and blue) are scattered in all directions by the nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the air. Since our eyes are more sensitive to blue light than violet light, and since some of the violet light is absorbed by the upper atmosphere, we perceive the scattered light as blue.",
